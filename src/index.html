            My name is Brandon Huelga. Nice to meet you! I am currently searching for a software engineering position to
            fund my puppy's evergrowing appetite for food and tennis balls. I was born and raised in Monterey Bay, which instilled in
            me a love for everything salt water. Graduating from Stanford University in 2018 allowed me to continue being a 
            California beach bum for my college career. I strive to always keep a sense of fun and cooperation with others in whatever
            challenging problems I come across in the workplace.

              </div>
              <p>
                I joined ListGen Inc, a real estate software startup, right out of Stanford as the sole programmer,
                excited to learn how a tech company is built up from the very ground level. As the only full-time employee,
                I worked closely with the founder designing the business model and developing a small demo with 
                HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. Shortly before the demo was complete, I decided to submit a
                full redesign, and restarted the project from scratch with a brand-new vision for the software,
                which came with a new sense of ownership of the web application. 
              </p><br>
              <p>
                During the creation of a new demo with JQuery, we brought on two contracting programmers for the
                backend and an extra technical consultant. I assumed the title of CTO, along with the responsibilities 
                of leading technical meetings, completing a full design of our NoSQL database, and keeping track of our 
                business milestones. Using the completed demo of our core product, I presented our business model to
                an investor, successfully raising $75k in investment capital.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                Having learned a huge amount in the process of creating the demo, I reflected on what I did well and
                how I could improve - thus, in order to create the world-class product that we were striving for, I
                decided to implement one more full rewrite of our software with the powerful framework, React. While I
                did not complete the application due to my leaving the company, the experience I had teaching myself
                new technologies was vital to my growth as a worker in the software industry. I parted ways with ListGen
                due to an itching for new opportunities. In my last month at the company, I trained a replacement for myself,
                and consolidated and documented the full codebase in order to leave the company as much on track as possible.

                  When I first began my education at Stanford, I was really drawn to the dormitory community.
                  There was focus on teamwork, collaboration, and supporting eachother while we all shared the
                  mutual suffering of classes, projects, and applications. I wanted to help foster this community
                  that had given so much to me, so I applied to become a Residential Assistant (RA) for Crothers Hall, my
                  home at Stanford, and it was the best decision I made throughout my time there.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  For two years, I worked with a team of twenty-one other staff members to promote the health,
                  happiness, and growth of the largest dorm on campus. I had the fun privilege of planning
                  activities and trips for the residents of the dorm, including two bitchin' ski trips in Lake Tahoe,
                  a visit to the "happiest place on Earth", a weekend camping in Yosemite, and creating a pop-up
                  pizzeria in basement kitchen. Working and learning with so many different people in the dorm
                  allowed me to grow alongside many different perspectives, which is something that I feel is a
                  necessity in my career environment, as well.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  Alongside the fun stuff, I was also the dorm treasurer my second year of being an RA, so I planned
                  the expenses for each quarter and kept track of all finances. I was glad to have this task that
                  reflected such a useful skill to have in the real-world. Working in the dorm alongside my peers allowed
                  me to meet some of the most incredible people in my life, and the experience helped me understand what
                  is really important to me in my career life.

                  My summer internship at CIG was my first real job in software development, and I was eager to do my best
                  after only having taken two Computer Sciences at Stanford. I landed this position after I committed to changing
                  my major from Chemical Engineering to CS, and it was a chance for me to see how the technical department
                  of a large company functioned. While I look back on my experience at CIG fondly, my biggest takeaway was what I
                  do not want from a software development job. I met great people and learned a great deal on the projects I was 
                  assigned to, but it was a static environment where I was confined to my cubicle.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  Along with bugfixes and maintentance, I worked on one major project during my three-month internship, which left 
                  a lasting positive effect on the company I wrote a script that cleansed all out-of-date, incorrect-input information in an
                  Excel sheet that contained all claims records that must be sent to a partner company (and believe me, there was a lot of incorrect info).
                  By standardizing the data, it allowed for much more efficient communication between CIG and their partner. Furthermore, 
                  I implemented extensive error checking in the system where claims are added to the sheet, forcing all inputs to be in the same format.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  CIG was the first company that I worked with a team of other programmers under the Agile methodology. I learned the
                  benefits of structured code delivery and collaboration, and working with a variety of programmers in my scrum team
                  provided me with exposure to different specialities and methods of development. From learning to write efficient
                  SQL queries to having my first taste of front-end web development, CIG was a vital stepping stone in allowing me
                  to discover the world of software engineering.

                  I came into Stanford aiming to be a Chemical Engineer, and figured that real laboratory experience as early as
                  possible would be a great experience. I eventually found myself a starting member of the Stanford Undergraduate
                  Monitoring Organization (SUMO) for the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility (SNF). My task was to work with a team
                  of my peers to run systematic tests on the machines throughout the facility and take measurements in order to
                  maintain that all machines were working correctly and document their operating health. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  This position required strong teamwork, background knowledge of chemistry, and an ability to adapt quickly and
                  learn the strict safety and cleanliness procedures of SNF. I worked in two specific areas of the lab: 
                  Photolithography and Dry Etching, each providing their own challenges and necessary theoretical knowledge to operate their
                  respective machines correctly. As the growth of SUMO began to accelerate, I noticed a lack of accountability and slowdowns
                  in the testing process. After identifying this, I worked to create a new standardized, less repetitive, list of monthly
                  tasks to document all the required machines, and presented it to the coordinators of SUMO. Within a month, we had
                  transitioned to this new system and were much more organized and efficient in our tasks. I continued to train new SUMO
                  members using our new workflow and helped grow the organization significantly. I eventually left SUMO
                  after I decided to switch to Computer Science, but my time in the Nanofabrication Facility was paramount in teaching me how
                  to take the initiative in identifying problems and finding their solutions.

                  If there is any one activity or experience that has defined my life the most, it is my introduction to martial arts
                  when I was six years old. My parents signed me up for Tang Soo Do, a Korean style of karate, much to my fear. But I quickly
                  grew to love it. It took eight years of training to consistently to begin teaching classes, and one year after that,
                  I achieved my goal of a first degree black belt. It is a common saying in martial arts that achieving black belt is only the
                  first step, where the real journey begins. This is 100% true. The amount of growth that I had, both technically and mentally,
                  in Tang Soo Do in the two years between my first and second degree black belts was only exclipsed by my three years between my
                  second and third. My third degree black belt was one of the most surreal moments of my life, as I finally caught up to
                  my two instructors, who were both third degrees, as well. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  My time teaching consistently was invaluable. I improved my confidence, my ability to speak to others, my ability to demonstrate
                  different moves and their applications, and how to work with people of vastly different levels of experience and maturities. 
                  There was so much that went into planning full workouts and privately coaching; I had to center workouts around certain concepts
                  and muscles, and tailor the workouts specifically to the students I was working with.When not on the mat teaching, I would
                  be behind the front desk, ready to introduce new students to the martial arts world, and fostering the community of the school.
                  My family at Bodyworx Martial Arts will always be with me, and I am outstandingly proud to represent a school who cares so much
                  about its students.
